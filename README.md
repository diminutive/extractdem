# extractdem

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of extractdem is to extract values from the [REMA Reference
Elevation Model of Antarctica](https://www.pgc.umn.edu/data/rema/), and
maybe other DEMs if this works.

## Installation

You don’t want to do this.

## What then

To use this do the following:

- [fork this repository](https://github.com/mdsumner/extractdem/fork)
- do whatever is required to enable Actions in the fork (couple of steps
  for us to document)
- make sure the repo can write the changes, there’s some auto-commit
  thing (my user name is currently set)
- delete the output Parquet, write your own “longlat_points.parquet”,
  commit the new parquet (it’s important that you have deleted the
  output Parquet and committe that change)
- push your changes to your fork, the action will generate the output
  Parquet in your fork

WIP!!!
